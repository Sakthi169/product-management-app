# Product Management App

This project is a web application that allows you to manage a list of products. It simulates a typical e-commerce backend by letting you perform all major CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data.

## Key Features

* **View Products**: Browse a paginated list of products fetched from a mock API.
* **Add New Products**: Create and add new products to the list. New products will be added to the front of the product list. These new products are handled locally within the app's state, as the mock API does not save them.
* **Edit Existing Products**: Update the details of any product, and see the changes reflected immediately on the screen.
* **Delete Products**: Remove products from the list.
* **Pagination**: Navigate through the product list with "Next" and "Previous" buttons, with the pagination controls intelligently enabled or disabled based on the available data.
